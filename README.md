# api-employee-directory
 Unit 8 of TreeHouse FrontEnd Course

To pass Unit 8 of my FrontEnd Dev course at Team TreeHouse, I'm creating this Employee Directory using API's.
For the success of my work I'll be needing to meet the following:

API Usage
❏ Use fetch to request 12 random users from the API
❏ New random employee information displays each time the page refreshes


User Directory

The directory includes the following:
❏ Employee Image
❏ First and Last Name
❏ Email
❏ City

Modal Window

Modal window displays the following details:
❏ Employee image
❏ Name
❏ Email
❏ Phone Number
❏ Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, state and postcode
❏ Birth date
❏ There is a way to close the modal window

Matching the Mockups

❏ Directory has been styled so that all the major elements are in place and roughly
matches the mockups
